# AI Experts Assignment (JS/TS)

This assignment evaluates your ability to:

- set up a small JavaScript/TypeScript project to run reliably (locally + in Docker),
- pin dependencies for reproducible installs,
- write focused tests to reproduce a bug,
- implement a minimal, reviewable fix.

## What you will do

### 1) Dockerfile (required)

Create a `Dockerfile` so the project can run the test suite in a non-interactive, CI-style environment.

Requirements:

- Your Docker image must run the test suite by default using npm test.
- Ensure npm test works in a clean environment (Docker) without manual steps.
- The build must install dependencies from package.json using npm install.
- The image must run tests by default (use: `CMD ["npm", "test"]`).

### 2) Pin dependencies (required)

- Pin dependency versions in package.json (no ^ / ~; use exact x.y.z).
- Do not commit lockfiles (package-lock.json, yarn.lock, pnpm-lock.yaml).

### 3) README updates (required)

Update this README to include:

- how to run the tests locally,
- how to build and run tests with Docker.

## How to run the tests locally

- Make sure a recent Node.js runtime (Node 18 or compatible) is installed on your machine.
- Install the project dependencies into the working directory.
- Run the project's test script to execute the full test suite.

## How to build and run the tests with Docker

- Build the project Docker image; the image performs a clean install of dependencies inside the container.
- Run the built image — it runs the test suite automatically and exits with the test result.

If you encounter permission issues talking to Docker, run the build and run commands with elevated privileges or add your user to the Docker group.

### 4) Find + fix a bug (required)

There is a bug somewhere in this repository.

Your tasks:

- Identify the bug.
- Apply the smallest possible fix to make the tests pass.
- Keep the change minimal and reviewable (no refactors).

## Constraints

- Keep changes minimal and reviewable.
- Do not refactor unrelated code.
- Do not introduce extra tooling unless required.
- You may add tests and the smallest code change needed to fix the bug.

### 5) EXPLANATION.md (required)

Create `EXPLANATION.md` (max 250 words) containing:

- **What was the bug?**
- **Why did it happen?**
- **Why does your fix solve it?**
- **One realistic case / edge case your tests still don’t cover**

## Submission

- Submit a public GitHub repository URL containing your solution to the Google form link provided.
